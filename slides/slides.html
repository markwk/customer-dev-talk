<h3 id="startup">Startup</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>a series of untested hypothesis and assumptions</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Put another way: <strong>Startups / founders / entrepreneurs exist to deal with uncertainty</strong>.</p>
<p>Steve Blank and other have shown that traditional business management processes and planning developed in MBA programs are not suited for startups, because startups operate in uncertainy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model. (Blank, 2012)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In sharp contrast, startups operate in “search” mode, seeking a repeatable and profitable business model. The search for a business model requires dramatically different rules, roadmaps, skill sets, and tools in order to minimize risk and optimize chances for success. (Blank, 2012)</p>

<p><small>Originated with Steve Blank and popularized by Eric Reis and Lean Startup. Dovetails well with many aspects of UX. </small></p>

<p>Steve Blank and others strive to make this an almost scientific process but it still very much an art rather than a purely empirical science.</p>

<h3 id="section-2"></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In practice, startups begin with a set of initial hypotheses (guesses), most of which will end up being wrong. Therefore, focusing on execution and delivering a product or service based on those initial, untested hypotheses is a going-out-of-business strategy.</p>
<p><small>Steve Blank</small></p>

<p>= Overemphasis on deliverables and product, underemphesis on users and customers.</p>

<p>Overemphasis on deliverables and product</p>
